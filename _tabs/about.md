Hi, I’m **Jiyun Kim (JYK)** — an **AI Agent–based Automation Systems Engineer** in the making.

I build and document **vision-guided robotic automation** with a strong focus on **real-world failures, recovery strategies, and reproducible fixes**.  
This site is my engineering logbook: what broke, why it broke, what I tried, and what finally worked.

---

## What I’m working on

### 1) Vision-guided robotic picking (YOLO → Robot grasp)
- Detect target objects (YOLO / vision models)
- Convert perception outputs into actionable robot coordinates (calibration, transforms)
- Execute pick & place with measurable success/failure signals
- Track failure patterns and improve reliability over time

### 2) ROS2 navigation practice (TurtleBot3)
- Nav2, localization, mapping
- TF tree debugging and parameter tuning
- Building intuition for real robots (timing, noise, drift)

### 3) Agentic workflows for automation (LangChain / LangGraph)
I don’t use agents as “magic control.”  
I use them as **operators**:
- experiment orchestration
- failure log analysis
- parameter sweep planning
- reporting and documentation automation

---

## What you’ll find here

- **Failure Logs**: real errors, symptoms, and final fixes
- **Debug Notes**: minimal repro, root cause, step-by-step recovery
- **System Notes**: architecture decisions and integration patterns
- **Short Demos**: videos/GIFs that prove the fix works

If you’re looking for “perfect tutorials,” this isn’t that.  
If you need **things that actually work in messy environments**, you’re in the right place.

## My focus areas

- Vision-guided manipulation (pick & place)
- Camera ↔ Robot calibration & coordinate transforms (TF)
- ROS2 / MoveIt2 system integration
- Failure-aware automation design (recovery-first mindset)
- Agentic orchestration for experiments and ops (LangChain/LangGraph)

## A personal note

I’m learning by building.  
My goal is to become someone who can take an automation idea from **prototype** to **reliable operation**, with clear evidence and repeatable processes.
